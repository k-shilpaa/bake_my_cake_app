# BakeMyCake

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
## JSON Server
In addition to the Angular development server, this project utilizes JSON Server for data-related tasks. Before running the Angular dev server, you need to start the JSON Server to serve your JSON data. To do so, navigate to the directory containing your JSON data file (e.g., db.json) and run: `json-server --watch db.json`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
